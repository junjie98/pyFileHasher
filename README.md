# pyFileHasher

## Project Backstory

This was actually a project when I was doing my Diploma back in 2018. The aim of the project was to write a python commandline script that lets a user choose a file and hash it (eg. MD5). The additional optional challenge of the assignment was to create the same program but with a GUI component to it. Of course being able to finish that challenge means additional marks. However, I did not finish the additional challenge because back then as I thought that creating a GUI component was going to be obscenely hard and time consuming.
